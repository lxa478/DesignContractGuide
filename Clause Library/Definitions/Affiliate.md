1. "Affiliate" of a party shall mean an entity directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by or under common control with that party
where control means the ownership or control, directly or indirectly,
of more than fifty percent (50%) of all of the voting power of the
shares (or other securities or rights) entitled to vote for the
election of directors or other governing authority, as of the date of
this Agreement or hereafter during the term of this Agreement;
provided that such entity shall be considered an Affiliate only for
the time during which such control exists, or a BMW dealer ("Center"),
or a dealer of an Affiliate ("Affiliate Dealer"). BMW may extend the
benefits granted in this Agreement to its Affiliates (for so long as
they remain Affiliates), provided that all such Affiliates become
bound in writing (for Selectica's benefit) to BMW's obligations under
this Agreement and that BMW assumes full responsibility for compliance
by such Affiliates with such obligations.

2. "AFFILIATE" means, with respect to any entity, any other entity
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under common control
with, such entity. For purposes of this definition, "control" (including the
terms "controlled by" and "under common control with") means the power, directly
or indirectly, to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies
of such entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract,
or otherwise. When used in this Agreement, the term "party" includes such
party's Affiliate.

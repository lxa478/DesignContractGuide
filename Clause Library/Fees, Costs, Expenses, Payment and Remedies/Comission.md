1. IV will be entitled to a commission (“Commission”) on the basis of paid subscription revenue (“Paid Subscription Revenue”) generated during each Contract Year of the Term. Paid Subscription Revenue means monies actually collected (less credit for returns, and reserves for bad debt and cancellations, adjusted from time to time based on actual experience) as the result of subscriptions sold to Hearst magazines during the Term (including not only the Magazines associated with the Magazine Sites, but all magazines published by Hearst, as well as any additional third-party magazines that Hearst or its affiliates are authorized to sell and that Hearst may designate for inclusion hereunder (it being understood that Hearst shall have no obligation to include or to seek permission to include such third-party magazines hereunder)) from (i) direct links on the Network, including from the Magazine Sites, to the Hearst Online Subscription Sales Sites; and (ii) Intermediate Links from Distributors resulting from IV Assisted Distribution Deals. IV’s Commission will be thirty percent (30%) for Paid Subscription Revenue of $2,225,000 per Contract Year or less subject to increase on the increment of Paid Subscription Revenue over that base number as reflected on Exhibit H. In the event that Paid Subscription Revenue in the second Contract Year of the Term is less than the greater of $3,500,000 or 250,000 paid orders (“Subscription Threshold”), IV shall not be entitled to any Commission on subscription sales during the third Contract Year of the Term. If Hearst enters a Deficit Deal, IV’s Commission shall be ten (10%) of Paid Subscription Revenue generated pursuant to such Deficit Deal, however one hundred (100%) of Paid Subscription Revenues from such Deficit Deals shall be counted for purposes of determining whether IV is entitled to an increase in its Commission Rate as set forth at Exhibit H and for purposes of counting towards reduction of the advertising Royalty Guarantee as set forth at Section 15(b) below. Hearst shall calculate IV’s Commission on a quarterly basis (being each three month period of a Contract Year measured from the Effective Date) on the basis of Paid Subscription Revenue received to date in that Contract Year, and will remit to IV the estimated amount owing, together with a statement of the accounting, and within one hundred twenty (120) days from the end of each Contract Year, shall make a final calculation as a true-up and Hearst shall account to IV for any additional sums that may be owing, or IV shall account to Hearst for any overpayments it may have received, as the case may be. IV shall not receive any Commission from subscription sales that result from (i) Third Party Links to Hearst Online Subscription Sites via Distributors or links from any other third party; (ii) Intermediate Links from relationships with Distributors that are not IV Assisted Distribution Deals; nor to (iii) subscription sales that result from marketing efforts of Hearst outside the Network environment, including without limitation, marketing to names included in Magazine User Data (“Non-Commissionable Subscription Sales”). Non-Commissionable Subscription Sales shall not be included for purposes of calculating any reduction in the advertising Royalty (as defined in Section 15) percentage to which Hearst may be subjected, nor to calculation of any increases in IV’s Commission, nor towards the Subscription Threshold, nor towards reduction of the advertising Royalty Guarantee as set forth in Section 15(b) below, with the following exception: revenue from subscription sales generated by Intermediate Links from relationships with Distributors that are not IV Assisted Distribution Deals (less credit for returns and reserves for bad debt and cancellations, adjusted from time to time based on actual experience) shall be aggregated with Paid Subscription Revenue (the aggregate being referred to as “Total Paid Subscription Revenue”) and shall count towards reduction of the advertising Royalty Guarantee as set forth in Section 15(b) below.

1. All Advertising (being any banner advertisements, site sponsorship arrangements, performance-based advertising, referrals, click-throughs, leads and bounties, and all other similar activities which do not produce revenues through direct selling, sold with respect to any Magazine Site) on the Magazine Sites will be sold by IV unless IV gives its prior consent for a sale by Hearst. “Net Advertising Revenue” means the gross revenue received by IV from the sale of advertisements on (a) the Magazine Sites exclusive, however, of advertisements sold on the Merchandise Sites, (b) any page of the Network, exclusive of the Merchandise Sites, that primarily contains Proprietary Content (other than teasers), and (c) any other page of the Network, exclusive of the Merchandise Sites, on which any article or feature that is Proprietary Content (other than teasers) is reproduced or duplicated substantially in its entirety; less agency fees (which shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of gross revenue from the sale of Advertisements), commissions (which shall not exceed eight percent (8%) of gross revenue from the sale of Advertisements, credits due to cancellations and provisions for bad debt. In no event shall Net Advertising Revenue for any period be less than the product of (A) gross advertising revenue recognized from the sale of all advertising on the Magazine Sites (exclusive of the Merchandise Sites) multiplied by (B) (i) the result of dividing the total number of advertisements served (impressions - specifically including banners, buttons, text ads, newsletters, cost per click and cost per acquisition) on the Magazine Sites (exclusive of the Merchandise Sites) by the total number of advertisements served (impressions - specifically including banners, buttons, text ads, newsletters, cost per click and cost per acquisition) on the Network (exclusive of the Merchandise Sites). IV agrees that Hearst shall be entitled to receive from IV a royalty (the "Royalty") computed on Net Advertising Revenues from such Contract Year. The Royalty payable to Hearst shall be equal to twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate Net Advertising Revenues from the Contract Year, reducible to fifteen percent (15%) in the event Paid Subscription Revenue in any Contract Year of the Term exceeds $2,225,000 but is less than $3,500,000.01; reducible to ten percent (10%) in the event Paid Subscription Revenue in any Contract Year exceeds $3,500,000 but is less than $5,000,000.01; and reducible to 0 in the event Paid Subscription Revenue in any Contract Year exceeds $5,000,000 (see table at Exhibit H). IV shall calculate Hearst’s Royalty on a quarterly basis (being each three month period of a Contract Year measured from the Effective Date) on the basis of Net Advertising Revenue received to date in that Contract Year and will remit to Hearst the estimated amount owing, together with a statement of the accounting, within forty five (45) days of each quarter, and at the end of each Contract Year, shall make a final calculation as a true-up and IV shall account to Hearst for any additional sums that may be owing, or Hearst shall account to IV for any overpayments it may have received, as the case may be.

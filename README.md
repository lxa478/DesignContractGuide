#Design Contract Guide

This project is an "Open Source" guidebook regarding design contracts and industry best practices.

##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive review of web design contracts. The goal is to discover and define the common elements of web design contracts and to provide  explanations, alternatives, example clauses, and guidance on each of those common elements. The end result will be a practical guidebook on creating your own web design contract. This guidebook will be of general applicability.

##Intended Audience
I do not assume that the readers have any experience with the law of contracting or law in general. I am not assuming any particular jurisdiction (Country, State, etc.), but because I am a California Attorney, I will have some bias toward California law.

I assume readers will have experience in web design and that they familiar with contracts in general.

##Structure
This guidebook will be assembled using folders for general topics. Subfolders are allowed for major subsections of general topics. Files are used for individual clause topics. Individual files may contain Situations (like use cases, or anecdotes), Problems, Solutions, Alternative Solutions, Example Clauses, Alternative Example Clauses, or anything else relevant to that particular topic. 

Example:

- Delays (General Topic)
	- By Client (Major Subsection)
		- Clients Expected Performance (File)
			> Description of Problem: Clients often fail to provide needed materials in a timely manner.
			> Solution: Day for Day extention of the deadline.
			> Alternative Solution: Halt work until materials are provided
			> Example Clauses: ***
			> *Anything else relevant*
		- Time Extension (File)
	- By Designer (Major Subsection)
		- Designer Reasonable Efforts (File)
		- Time Extension (File)

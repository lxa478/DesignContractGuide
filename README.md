#Design Contract Guide

This project is an "Open Source" guidebook regarding design contracts and industry best practices.

##Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive review of web design contracts. The goal is to discover and define the common elements of web design contracts and to provide  explanations, alternatives, example clauses, and guidance on each of those common elements. The end result will be a practical guidebook on creating your own web design contract. 

The end result is a free and reliable resource for freelance web designers. Hiring an attorney to draft documents can be prohibitively expensive, especially for a freelance web designer. I hope this project will lessen that burden.

##Intended Audience
I do not assume that the readers have any experience with the law of contracting or law in general. I am not assuming any particular jurisdiction (Country, State, etc.), but because I am a California Attorney, I will have some bias toward California law.

I assume readers will have experience in web design and that they familiar with contracts in general.

##Structure
This guidebook will be assembled using folders for general topics. Subfolders are allowed for major subsections of general topics. Files are used for individual clause topics. Individual files may contain Situations (like use cases, or anecdotes), Problems, Solutions, Alternative Solutions, Example Clauses, Alternative Example Clauses, or anything else relevant to that particular topic. 

The initial structure of this project will be a "Clause Library" containing clauses common to web design contracts. These clauses will be grouped by topic. 

The second step will be to analyse the "Clause Library" to determine the problem each clause topic is trying to solve (ie. why have this clause and what does it try to accomplish). The desired outcome will be a list of common issues that web designers face in their work and the various solutions available.

The third step is to combine issues into logical groups and subgroups creating an index for the guidebook.

The fourth step is to create "Business Case" scenarios and example clauses that solve that scenario. Ie. "I want to get paid." --> "Fees. Client agrees to pay Designer $XXX." The end result will be a guidebook that lets designers build their own contracts based on common business requirements.
